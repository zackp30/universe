I had decided to embark on a journey, to see if there was any other creatures like me, in the sense of anatomy, not shear coincidental atomic gluing (as I aptly called it).

I fired up the engines. Being careful not to destroy the nearby planet in the process. I then accelerated to 5 times the speed of light. I travelled for a few years, finding nothing, then, one day, I found something while exploring a planet.

The planet's atmosphere was mostly composed of nitrogen @earth_atmosphere, and full of oxygen breathing life forms, because logic said so. It had pristine lakes, beautiful oceans, and vast forests. This was all untrue of course, since this was the year <#json .dates.landed_on_earth[0]|data/dates.json>, we were on some rubbish planet called "Earth", which had been polluted over a few years thanks to some ruddy humans. Anyway,

I had found.

A lifeform.

Not of the fish kind.

Or the bird kind.

Of the humanoid kind.

This was a good thing.

I think.

I hope.

Probably not.

Worth a shot.

I approached it.

It approached me.

I waved.

It waved back.

I decided to say "Hello", well, try to, it took me a while to get muster the courage since this was the first humanoid lifeform I had seen, uh, ever, you could class me as the pinnacle of "forever-aloneness" even though, that term, given the current circumstances of me just seeing another humanoid, proves it quite contradictory. Thanks to coincidental atomic gluing, I had said "Hello" in the correct language, which was convenient I guess. We then started to have a polite conversation about our surroundings. Yes, we talked about the weather, that's how bad at social conversation I was, and still am. Anyway, we talked for a while about the planet and its pollution.
