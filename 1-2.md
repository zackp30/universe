I had decided to embark on a journey, to see if there was any other creatures like me, in the sense of anatomy, not shear coincidental atomic gluing (as I aptly called it).

I fired up the engines. Being careful not to destroy the nearby planet in the process. I then accelerated to 5 times the speed of light. I travelled for a few years, finding nothing, then, one day, I found something while exploring a planet.

A lifeform.

Not of the fish kind.

Or the bird kind.

Of the humanoid kind.

This was a good thing.

I approached it.

It approached me.

I wave.

It waves back.
