I awoke, still inside the bridge. I got up and went to the window, to find the
ship in a huge mess of lava, rock, plasma, water, polygons, anomalies, and
dirt. These were the remnants of every single planet, minor-planet, star,
blackhole, whitehole, wormhole, neutron, atom, electron, and several other
yet-to-be-identified-or-named things that is, or was, in the universe. I knew
the composition of the intergalactic "soup" because it had happened before. "Oh,
snap" I said, knowing what this meant.

It meant that I, the system administrator of virtual universe 0, had single
handily murdered everyone within my universe, again.
