"Corruption of universe deemed system's fault. System is at fault. System is at fault." said the computer with a monolithic voice. "Corruption of universe, sector fault in EXT4 filesystem: /" it exclaimed. I was, of course, sleeping at the time and yelled out with a loud "FUCK!", as I was abruptly awoken by the noise. I quickly ran down to the bridge, stopped, and stared, at the site of 25,120,113 red lights, all were blinking, all of which meant bad things.

I had left something running last night. A program to calculate a new prime number, new in the sense we have a prime number 17,425,170 digits @primes long. Generating a new prime number takes a lot of time, money, and power. 7000 yottabytes of memory had been dedicated to the task. This was simply for fun of course.
