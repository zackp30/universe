It was a quiet day/night/whatever in space; nothing had happened. Literally. The
universe had been paused for maintenance for the past 72 hours.

Somehow I had broken the universe during an upgrade of the kernel. "You've
broken shit, again." System chimed. "I don't know how you manage to do this all
the time, this is the second time this week." Previously I had broken the disk
drive by throwing a cookie at it by accident.
