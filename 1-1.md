"Corruption of universe deemed system's fault. System is at fault. Probability
of system being at fault is 1 over 1." said the computer with a robotic
voice. "Corruption of universe, sector fault in EXT4 filesystem: root. Block
12029393843828 is dying. Block 2827514142637 is dead. Block 382829927746565 is
dead. Disk replacement necessary. Staff intervention necessary." it exclaimed. I
was, of course, sleeping at the time and yelled out with a loud "FUCK!", as I
was abruptly awoken by the noise. I quickly ran down to the bridge, stopped, and
stared, at the site of 25,120,113 red lights, all were blinking, all of which
meant bad things, like the cake bakers had broken, life support was failing, the
Lady Gaga containment facility had failed, among others. I noticed Lady Gaga
walking around the bridge, I ignored her.

I then noticed, that, around me, through the windows, planets appeared to be
falling, and the System stating "The planets are falling. Please seek
assistance. Again, the planets are falling, please seek assistance. The system
does not know what to do. Again, SEEK ASSISTANCE" along with weird polygons
appearing everywhere. I was mildly terrified, not too much, it is important to
remain vaguely calm when planets start falling and weird polygons appear
everywhere. During that event several errors started appearing, literally,
appearing before my eyes, saying things like "Thin client 3482903829032
disconnected, attempting to reconnect... reconnection failed please try again"
and "Host 907827846923569 is trying to reconnect... authentication protocol
failure please try again", and another one saying "OOM Killer invoked, process 1
reached memory limitations of this system... attempting to reboot."

That was impossible. I started to panic, I had no idea what the shit was
happening, perhaps I had pressed the wrong button, I simply didn't know.
I watched in fear as more and more planets started to fail. After a few seconds
a planet had fallen on top of the ship. A very loud thud echoed throughout the
ship along with a loud "SHIT!" exclaimed from myself. The ship also started to
fall. "Ship is now falling, again, for the last time, seek assistance."

"Fusion engines have been destroyed. Please seek immediate assistance. Seeking
assistance... Calling local pizza restaurant... failed." exclaimed the
computer. Again, I exclaimed with "shit", maybe even preceded with "well" for
variety.

Anyway, the ship, and I, were falling. Fast. Very fast. We crashed into several
other planets, and rolled off. I fell on the floor and was knocked out.

I then remembered the computer asked to have the disk replaced.
