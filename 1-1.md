Welcome to the Universe, the biggest cosmic mishmash to ever exist.

The Universe is big, powerful, and theoretically never ending, it knows no bounds.

Nobody has yet to exit the universe, because nobody has yet to want to. That
will probably change some day, but this is not within the scope of this
book. This story is about a person who wished to create a spaceship to go faster
than the speed of light, original I know, this has one twist however.

The person was a 15 year old boy, with the only knowledge being that of
computers, and basic knowledge about the solar system around him.

This is the story of me, Zack Piper, and my imagination.

Of course this story isn't real (if only...) but this is what i've been
imagining for the past 7 years, welcome to my imagination, the most
technologically advanced thing I wish to be real.

We begin with, of course, a spaceship:

It's dark in space, well, kinda dark, and kinda not. There's quite a few stars
here and there, other than that, a complete vacuum can be rather dark.

Anyway, I was sat in my cabin, with a ship the size of Sirius A (slightly bigger
than the Earth sun known as "The Sun") floating, which was boring, but still, I
was in the biggest spaceship ever to exist, some enemy spacecraft immediately
fuck off when they see me. The ship was known as "BESSY", and the on-board
computer was known as "System".
