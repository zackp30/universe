"Corruption of universe deemed system's fault. System is at fault. System is at fault." said the computer with a monolithic voice. "Corruption of universe, sector fault in EXT4 filesystem: root" it exclaimed. I was, of course, sleeping at the time and yelled out with a loud "FUCK!", as I was abruptly awoken by the noise. I quickly ran down to the bridge, stopped, and stared, at the site of 25,120,113 red lights, all were blinking, all of which meant bad things.

I had left something running last night. A program to calculate a new prime number, new in the sense we have a prime number 17,425,170 digits @primes long. Generating a new prime number takes a lot of time, money, and power. 7000 yottabytes of memory had been dedicated to the task. This was simply for fun of course, but now it wasn't.

I quickly started scanning through the logs of what had happened last night. I scanned past the pigeons of London being incinerated by an unknown object, Lady Gaga not wearing a bacon dress, and the tower of Antarctica existing, but not at the same time. All of which didn't explain what had happened. I then stumbled upon it. A single speck of dirt had got its way into the hard drive (I was also glad I decided to log pieces of dirt entering hard drives), resulting in the 5 meter wide disk being damaged, and also resulting in 25,120,113 lights turning from green to red, due to life support, kitchen supervisors, and cake bakers failing. "Aha! It wasn't the prime number generator after all." I thought to myself. I pulled out a clone of the disk. Due to it being 5 damn meters wide it was quite heavy. I then destroyed the other disk because destroying broken disks is fun, especially if you have a load of them left and have a nice flamethrower. After that I plugged in the other one, and let all the 25,120,113 lights turn from red, back to green.

The universe is a strange place. London had gone from lots and lots of pigeons, to none overnight, Lady Gaga somehow was not wearing a bacon dress, and the Tower of Antarctica never existed. I was also a strange thing. Without the *huge* coincidence of multiple atoms, came together, just after the big bang, "gluing" themselves together, and started to vaguely resemble that of a humanoid creature, which had, in order to survive the extreme conditions of the big bang, developed the ability to not breath for a *very* long time, be impervious to radiation, survive the vacuum of space, and have a good brain. This was of course something that was not *meant* to happen, but *had*, indeed, happened.

After the huge coincidence that is me, I decided to build something, a ship of course (why would I build a car in space?). When the ship was finished, it was *huge*, to say the least. It was <#shipmetric length|main> meters long, <#shipmetric width|main> meters wide, <#shipmetric height|main> meters high, and was <#shipmetric weight|main> megatonnes heavy. It had its own gravitational pull, machines had to be invented in order for it not to pull planets into it, of which we will cover later. This was built by the "waste" of the big bang, essentially recycling parts of the universe, to build a very powerful ship. The entire thing was capable of Faster than Light travel, and had a *very* powerful computer.

The computer was very powerful indeed, it sported <#json .computers.main.cpu.cores|data/misc.json> CPU cores <#json .computers.main.cpu.type|data/misc.json>, <#json .computers.main.memory|data/misc.json> of RAM, just for the sake of excessive amounts of power. Anyway, enough of that for now.
